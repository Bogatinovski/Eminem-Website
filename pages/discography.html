								Infinite is the solo debut album of American rapper Eminem, released August 10, 1996, through Web Entertainment. The album was recorded at the Bass Brothers' studio, known as the "Bassmint" and produced by Mr. Porter, Proof and Peter Schorn. It features vocals from fellow rappers Proof, Mr. Porter, Eye-Kyu, Three and Thyme. The album sold only about 1,000 copies, and received rare reviews, which were mixed, mainly criticizing the album's production but praising Eminem's lyrical ability. While Eminem's future albums would prove more successful, the rapper still gained some recognition for his debut effort.
							</p>
							<h1>Background and composition</h1>
							<p>
								Marshall "Eminem" Mathers was initially signed to FBT Productions in 1992, run by brothers Jeff and Mark Bass. Eminem also held a minimum-wage job of cooking and dish washing at the restaurant Gilbert's Lodge at St. Clair Shores for some time. In 1996, Eminem's debut album Infinite, which was recorded at the "Bassmint", a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent label Web Enteinment. Eminem was encouraged by others, who noted he sounded similar to rapper AZ. Mr. Porter produced the entire album, while Proof programmed the drums.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mathers purposely made Infinite's songs "radio-friendly" in hopes of getting on the air on Detroit radio stations. It features vocals from fellow rappers Proof, Mr. Porter, Eye-Kyu, Three and Thyme. Only around a thousand copies of the album were made. Subjects covered in Infinite included his struggles with raising his newborn daughter Hailie Jade Mathers while on limited funds and his strong desire to get rich. After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. In 2009, Thisis50.com re-released it as a free download on their website to build anticipation for Eminem's highly anticipated comeback album Relapse.
							</p>
							<h1>Reception</h1>
							<p>
								Eminem recalls: "Obviously, I was young and influenced by other artists, and I got a lot of feedback saying that I sounded like AZ. Infinite was me trying to figure out how I wanted my rap style to be, how I wanted to sound on the mic and present myself. It was a growing stage. I felt like Infinite was like a demo that just got pressed up." Allmusic gave it an "Editor Score" of 2.5 out of 5 stars, without a review. Rob Kenner of Complex gave the album an unfavorable review, saying Eminem "has yet to develop his own distinctive style".

								The Slim Shady LP is the second studio album and first major release from the American rapper Eminem. It was released on February 23, 1999, under Web Records and Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan. following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself. The majority of the record's lyrical content is written from the perspective of the rapper's alter ego Slim Shady, whom the rapper created on Slim Shady EP (1997). The lyrics are noted for their over-the-top depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity.
							</p>
							<p>
								The album was met with both critical and commercial success; critics praised Eminem for his unique lyrical style, and the record debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart behind TLC's FanMail with 283,000 copies sold in its opening week. The first official single, "My Name Is", peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Slim Shady LP went on to be certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and in 2003, the album was ranked number 273 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an unknown rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records, and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album. In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth. The rapper was also sued multiple times following the release of the album for reasons including slander and unauthorized sampling.
							</p>
							<h1>Background</h1>
							<p>
								Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1995, his debut album Infinite, which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent label Web Entertainment. Infinite achieved little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off."[2] After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.
							</p>
							<p>
								The disappointment of Infinite inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: "Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it". Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play Slim Shady EP. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'" Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on his major label debut album.
							</p>
							<h1>Recording</h1>
							<p>
								The Slim Shady LP was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. Much of the album was recorded when Eminem was under the influence of ecstasy; Dr. Dre described the experience by saying "We get in there, get bugged out, stay in the studio for fuckin' two days. Then you're dead for three days. Then you wake up, pop the tape in, like, 'Let me see what I've done.'" On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished "My Name Is" in an hour. Three other songs, including "Role Model", were also recorded that day.
							</p>
							<p>
								"'97 Bonnie & Clyde", which was formerly featured on Slim Shady EP as "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was uncomfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. He explained, "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song, and she bugged the fuck out." The song "Guilty Conscience" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre "fell out of his chair laughing" upon hearing the lyric. "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.
							</p>
							<h1>Lyrics</h1>
							<p>
								Many of the songs from The Slim Shady LP are written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish and over-the-top depictions of violence, which he refers to as "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff" The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: "Why can't people see that records can be like movies? The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen." Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, "I have a fairly salty relationship with women ... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', its so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'" Despite the record's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word "nigga" on the album, with the rapper noting, "It's not in my vocabulary." The Slim Shady LP begins with a "Public Service Announcement" introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. Later in the album, a skit entitled "Paul" features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to "tone down" his lyrics.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Guilty Conscience" is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre. The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the "angel" and "devil" sides of the characters' conscience, respectively. The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film National Lampoon's Animal House, in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party. In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in "Guilty Conscience", the outcome is unclear.[10] On "My Fault", Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave. "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife's corpse. It is an epilogue to the song "Kim", although "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that his girlfriend was keeping him from seeing his daughter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that "There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it's not because of what it describes, it's how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words." On the song "Brain Damage", Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school.
							</p>
							<p>
								Although many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing The Slim Shady LP, Anthony Bozza of Rolling Stone described Eminem as "probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks. Eminem was inspired to write "Rock Bottom" after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as "discouraged, hungry, and malnourished." "If I Had" follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is "tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour". In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the "white trash" stereotype.
							</p>
							<h1>Production</h1>
							<p>
								The album's production was handled primarily by the Bass Brothers, Dr. Dre, and Eminem. The beats have been compared to West Coast hip hop and G-funk musical styles. Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that "The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow Em to play."[14] According to the staff at IGN, "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" is backed by the "lulling serenity of a super silky groove".[21] "Cum On Everybody" contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while "My Name Is", which is built around a piano sample from British musician Labi Siffre's "I Got The", features a prominent bassline and psychedelic-style keyboards. "I'm Shady" was originally written over a Sade track, but after hearing a sample of Curtis Mayfield's "Pusherman" in Ice-T's song "I'm Your Pusher", Eminem decided it would be more fitting to use "Pusherman".
							</p>
							<p>
								Eminem's vocal inflection on the record has been described as a "nasal whine"; Jon Pareles of The New York Times likened his "calmly sarcastic delivery" to "the early Beastie Boys turned cynical". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper's vocals to "Pee-wee Herman with a nasal Midwestern accent". A skit entitled "Lounge" appears before "My Fault" featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating rat pack crooners. Jeff Bass came up with the line "I never meant to give you mushrooms" for the skit, which in turn inspired Eminem to write "My Fault".
							</p>
							<h1>Commercial response</h1>
							<p>
								In the album's first week of release, The Slim Shady LP sold 283,000 copies, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart behind TLC's FanMail. The record remained on the Billboard 200 for 100 weeks.[29] It also reached number one on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart, staying on the chart for 92 weeks. On April 5, 1999, ten days after the album's release, The Slim Shady LP was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies. On November 15, 2000, the record was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.[30] "My Name Is", the album's lead single, peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the chart for ten weeks.[31] The single additionally peaked at number 18 on the magazine's R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, 29 on the Pop Songs chart, and 37 on the Alternative Songs chart. "Guilty Conscience" reached number 56 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, while "Just Don't Give a Fuck" peaked at number 62 on the chart. By November, 2013, the album sold 5,437,000 copies in the United States.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of the United States, The Slim Shady LP reached number nine on the weekly Canadian Albums Chart and remained on the chart for twelve weeks. Additionally, the album was certified double platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 200,000 units. The record was also certified double platinum in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number ten on the UK Albums chart and remained on the chart for a total of 114 weeks. In Australia, the album peaked at number 49 on the ARIA Chart, and was eventually certified platinum in the country. The album was also certified gold in the Netherlands and New Zealand, where it peaked at the number 20 and 23 chart positions, respectively.
							</p>
							<h1>Critical reception</h1>
							<p>
								The album was met with generally positive reviews, with many critics focusing on Eminem's lyrical style. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's "expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination", adding that "Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make The Slim Shady LP one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music." David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the album's "unapologetic outrageousness" as a reaction to the "soul positivity" of conscious hip hop, noting that "The Slim Shady LP marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes ... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch." Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that "He isn't afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time" but lamented the "sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem."
							</p>
							<p>
								Many reviewers commented on the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, "Eminem's music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away." Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that "the wife-killing jokes of "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record." Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is "sophomoric and uninspired" at times, Eminem's "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas." Mike Rubin of Spin noted that "his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are." Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that "Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together."
							</p>
							<h1>Accolades</h1>
							<p>
								Rolling Stone ranked The Slim Shady LP number 273 on the magazine's list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" and 33 on its list of the "100 Best Albums of the '90s".[55][56] At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 1999, the record won Best Rap Album, while "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance. "Ken Kaniff" was listed as number 15 on Complex's "50 Greatest Hip-Hop Skits" list, while the "Public Service Announcement" introduction to the album, along with the "Public Service Announcement 2000" introduction from The Marshall Mathers LP, was listed as number 50 on the list. It also won Outstanding National Album at the 2000 Detroit Music Awards.
							</p>
							<h1>Aftermath</h1>
							<p>
								After the success of The Slim Shady LP, Eminem went from an unknown rapper to a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper Proof.[60] Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: "This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree ... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't stop myself from spoiling her."
							</p>
							<p>
								To promote The Slim Shady LP, Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule. He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs. He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, "I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder." However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on Total Request Live.
							</p>
							<p>
								Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial by Billboard editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery." During a radio appearance in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about "slapping a pregnant bitch" to the extent that she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP on-air. The rapper defended himself by saying, "My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be."
							</p>
							<h1>Lawsuits</h1>
							<p>
								On September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for slander based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line "I just found out my mom does more dope than I do" from "My Name Is". After a two-year long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a "lawsuit queen", and alleging that "That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life." She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.

								In December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in Roseville, Michigan who was made the subject of the song "Brain Damage" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey's attorney stated "Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry ... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism." In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior. Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of Rolling Stone. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a judge, who, in her explanation, wrote a humorous rap verse: "Bailey thinks he's entitled to some monetary gain/Because Eminem used his name in vain."

								In September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that "Guilty Conscience" contains an unauthorized sample of "Pigs Go Home" composed for the film Getting Straight by her husband, Ronald Stein, who died in 1988. Although the album's liner notes state that the song contains an "interpolation" of "Pigs Go Home", Stein is not credited as a composer and his wife was not paid royalties for use of the song. The lawsuit requested for 5 percent of the retail list price of 90 percent of the all copies of the record sold in America, and 2.5 percent of the retail price of 90 percent of the copies of the album sold internationally.

								The Marshall Mathers LP is the third studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on May 23, 2000, by Interscope Records in the United States, and on September 11, 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and Eminem, along with The 45 King, Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man.
								The album sold more than 1.76 million copies in the US in the first week alone, becoming the fastest-selling studio album by any solo artist in American music history. In 2001, the album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. The album was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2011 for shipping 10 million copies in the United States. Since its release in 2000, the album sold 10,766,000 copies in the United States and more than 21 million copies worldwide.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Marshall Mathers LP has been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time by Rolling Stone, Time, and XXL] Rolling Stone placed the album at number 7 on its list of the best albums of the 2000s. The album was ranked number 244 by Rolling Stone on their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2010, Rhapsody ranked it number 1 on their "The 10 Best Albums by White Rappers" list.
								A sequel to the album titled The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was announced during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and was released on November 5, 2013.
							</p>
							<h1>Background</h1>
							<p>
								Inspired by the disappointment of his debut album, Infinite (1996), Eminem created the alter ego Slim Shady, whom he introduced on Slim Shady EP (1997).[18] After placing second in the annual Rap Olympics, Eminem was noticed by the staff at Interscope Records and eventually CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played Slim Shady EP for rapper Dr. Dre.[18] Eminem and Dr. Dre then recorded The Slim Shady LP (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence. The Slim Shady LP became a commercial and critical success, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week. At the 41st Grammy Awards in 1999, the record won Best Rap Album, while the album's lead single "My Name Is" won Best Rap Solo Performance.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an unknown rapper to a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle. He married his girlfriend Kimberly Scott, the mother of his daughter, in June 1999, despite the fact that the song "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her. The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and reflected, "I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me." Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery".
							</p>
							<h1>Recording</h1>
							<p>
								The Marshall Mathers LP was recorded in a two-month-long "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to "map out" each song. He described himself as a "studio rat" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.' We just wait and see what happens when we get there." Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from "fucking around" in the studio; "Marshall Mathers" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while "Criminal" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. "Kill You" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.
							</p>
							<p>
								The song "Stan" was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for "Stan" differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about." Dido later heard "Stan" and enjoyed it, and observed, "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it.' When they sent ['Stan'] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.'"
							</p>
							<p>
								The record label speculated that Eminem would be the first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect." After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote "The Way I Am" as his way of saying, "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is.' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen." However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people."
							</p>
							<h1>Lyrical content</h1>
							<p>
								The Marshall Mathers LP contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to The Slim Shady LP. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, most notably his mother and Kim Mathers, his former wife. The Marshall Mathers LP was released in both clean and explicit versions. However, some lyrics of the album are censored even on its explicit version. Some songs are censored because of events surrounding the album's release, mostly the Columbine High School Massacre. Unlike Eminem's debut, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP is more introspective in its lyrics and uses less of the Slim Shady persona. Its lyrical style has been described as horrorcore with Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that the album's lyrics "[blur] the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary".
							</p>
							<p>
								Most songs cover Eminem's childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother ("Kill You"), the relationship struggles with his wife ("Kim"), his struggles with his superstardom and expectations ("Stan", "I'm Back", & "Marshall Mathers"),[31] his return and effect on the music industry ("Remember Me?", "Bitch Please II"), his drug use ("Drug Ballad"), his effect on the American youth and society ("The Way I Am", "Who Knew"), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark themes ("Criminal"). Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on the album were overwhelmingly well received among critics and the hip hop community, many praising Eminem's verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.
								The album contains various lyric samples and references. It features a number of lines mimicking songs from Eric B. & Rakim's album Paid in Full. The chorus to "The Way I Am" resembles lines from the song "As the Rhyme Goes On", and the first two lines from the third verse of "I'm Back" are based on lines from "My Melody". Two lines in "Marshall Mathers" parody the song "Summer Girls" by LFO. Bitch Please II is the only composition that Eminem and Snoop Dogg did together.
							</p>
							<p>
								The record also contains lyrics that have been considered to be homophobic. The song "Criminal" features the line "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or les...Hate fags?/The answer's yes."[36] The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for "encourag[ing] violence against gay men and lesbians". However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine The Advocate, editor Dave White writes, "If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he's to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears' invitation to 'hit me baby, one more time'." Eminem noted that he began using the word "faggot" more frequently when "people got all up in arms about it...to piss them off worse" but added that "I think its hard for some people to understand that for me the word 'faggot' has nothing to do with sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads."
							</p>
							<h1>Clean version</h1>
							<p>
								In his book Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control, author Raiford Guins writes that the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP "resembles a cross between a cell phone chat with terrible reception...and a noted hip-hop lyricist suffering from an incurable case of hiccups." This version of the album often either omits words completely or obscures them with added sound effects. The clean version of the album did not censor all profanity. Words like "ass," "bitch," "goddamn," "shit" and "nigga" were uncensored. However, on the track "The Real Slim Shady", the words "bitch" and "shit" were censored out, as they used the clean version released for radio. References to violence and weapons were also significantly altered, and the song "Kill You" and "Drug Ballad" are written as "**** You" and "Ballad" on the back cover of the album. The song "Kim" is removed completely and replaced by the South Park-themed "The Kids". "The Kids" was also featured on limited edition copies of the uncensored album.
							</p>
							<p>
								Significant edits were made to aggressive and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred recently at Columbine High School, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. Explicit drug content was also removed.
								Some songs have words censored even on the explicit version; "I'm Back" censors "I take seven [kids] from [Columbine]", "Marshall Mathers" censors "It doesn't matter [your attorney Fred Gibson's a] faggot", and "Kim" censors "There's a [four] year old little [boy] laying dead with a slit throat". The former line was since repeated without censorship in the 2013 song Rap God.
								The intro track "Public Service Announcement 2000" is replaced with two seconds of silence on the clean version of the album.
							</p>
							<h1>Production</h1>
							<p>
								Much of the first half of the album was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem's vocals. Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of "Marshall Mathers" to the atmosphere of "Amityville". The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song "Thank You" for "Stan", while adding a slow bass line.
							</p>
							<h1>Singles</h1>
							<p>
								"The Real Slim Shady" was the first single released from The Marshall Mathers LP. The song was a hit, becoming Eminem's first chart topper in some countries, and garnering much attention for insulting various celebrities. The chorus is: "I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady/All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating/So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up, please stand up, please stand up?" which is Eminem's most noted lines and has been parodied in popular media.
							</p>
							<p>
								"The Way I Am" was released as the second single from The Marshall Mathers LP. "The Way I Am" features a much darker sound and much deeper subject matter than "The Real Slim Shady". It features the first beat Eminem produced on his own, featuring an ominous bassline, a piano loop, and chimes. In the song, Eminem lashes out at people he feels are putting too much pressure on him, including overzealous fans and record executives expecting him to top the success of his hit single "My Name Is". He also shares thoughts on the Columbine school shooting. Marilyn Manson is mentioned in the song in the lines: "When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school/And they blame it on Marilyn/And the heroin/Where were the parents at?/And look where it's at/Middle America, now it's a tragedy/Now it's so sad to see/An upper-class city/having this happening." The video features Marilyn Manson with the word "WAR" scrawled on his stomach. The two later toured together performing the song at their own concerts, and often making appearances on stage even when not singing the song. During the chorus, Eminem questions his identity in the face of massive amounts of attention from millions of strangers. While his previous album, The Slim Shady LP, was somewhat more cartoonish than this album, and he rapped therein as a distinct character who goes by Slim Shady, his critics believed that Eminem, Marshall Mathers, and Slim Shady were identical. Similar to other musicians and artists who lost their identity in some fictional construct (David Bowie, Alice Cooper), Eminem expresses his doubts about who he has become. A Danny Lohner remix featuring Marilyn Manson was also recorded noticing how the original version used super dark lyrics and elements with the remix being even darker using some of Manson's industrial metal elements from his music and Manson's "oh"'s in the song and his screamed vocals were sampled in his 1996 hit, "The Beautiful People". The remix is available on the deluxe edition bonus disc on the album.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Stan" was the third single released from The Marshall Mathers LP. It peaked at number one in the United Kingdom and Australia. The song is perhaps Eminem's most critically acclaimed song and has been called a 'cultural milestone'. "Stan" is a story of a fan who is obsessed with Eminem and writes to him but doesn't receive a reply. Stan drives his car off a bridge with his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk. The first three verses are delivered by Stan, the first two in letter form and the third being spoken as he is about to drive off a bridge and is recording a cassette with the intent (but, he realizes too late, not the means) to send it to Eminem.[44] The song makes heavy use of sound effects, with rain, thunder and windscreen wipers heard in the background, as well as pencil scratchings during the first two verses, and then as Stan drives off the bridge, listeners hear tires screeching and a crashing sound, followed by a splash of water, in a style similar to the 1964 songs "Dead Man's Curve" and "Leader of the Pack". The fourth verse is Eminem responding to Stan, only realizing at the last second that he has heard about Stan's death on the news as he was writing to him. The song was produced by The 45 King and samples the first couple of lines of "Thank You" by Dido as the chorus. "Stan" was ranked number 3 on a list of the greatest rap songs in history by Q, and came in tenth in a similar survey conducted by Top40-Charts.com.[46] Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time ranked it number 290. It was also ranked the 270th best song of all time in November 2008 by Acclaimedmusic.net.
							</p>
							<h1>Title and artwork</h1>
							<p>
								Two covers of the album exist. The original features Eminem sitting on the porch of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, "I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me." Eminem considered naming the album Amsterdam after a trip to the city shortly after the release of The Slim Shady LP, in which he and his friends engaged in heavy drug use and where he wrote most of the album. The second cover features a black and white photo of Eminem sitting on the floor beside wooden bars on a wall. Above the bars are wooden doors. One of the doors have the number 21 on it. The "free" use of drugs Eminem observed during his time in Amsterdam greatly influenced his desire to openly discuss drug use in his music and Dutch journalists inspired some of the content on the album.
							</p>
							<h1>Commercial performance</h1>
							<p>
								During the first week of sales, the album sold 1.76 million copies, becoming the fastest-selling rap album in history, more than doubling the previous record held by Snoop Dogg's 1993 debut Doggystyle, and topping Britney Spears' record for highest one-week sales by any solo artist. The album sold 800,000 in its second week, 598,000 in its third week, and 519,000 in its fourth week for a four week total of 3.65 million, and became one of few albums to sell over half a million copies for four consecutive weeks. It finished out the year 2000 as the second highest selling album of the year with over 7.9 million sold. In 2010, the Nielsen Company reported that up until November 2009, the album had sold 10,216,000 units in the US, making it the fourth-best selling album of the decade. By November 2013, the album has sold 10,777,000 copies in the United States, being Eminem's best selling album in his native country.
							</p>
							<h1>Critical response</h1>
							<p>
								The Marshall Mathers LP received acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews. Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters called Eminem "clever" and stated, "That Eminem's imagination takes him to dark and disagreeable places is predictable; that he exhibits it so relentlessly and so profitably is something else." Chuck Eddy of The Village Voice gave it a rave review and noted "a self-awareness and emotional complexity [...] that Eminem previously seemed incapable of". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A rating, indicating "a record that rarely flags for more than two or three tracks"] Christgau called Eminem "exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit", while declaring the album "a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that's both personal and political".
							</p>
							<p>
								Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album "fairly brilliant" and noted its production's liquid basslines, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes. NME described it as a "[g]ruelling assault course of lyrical genius". Entertainment Weekly dubbed it "indefensible and critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable" and "the first great pop record of the 21st century". Vibe stated, "Eminem has crafted the best album of the year so far with The Marshall Mathers LP and it comes dangerously close to being a classic." Touré of Rolling Stone gave it four out of five stars and commended Dr. Dre's production and Eminem's varied rapping style, while calling the album "a car-crash record: loud, wild, dangerous, out of control, grotesque, unsettling. It's also impossible to pull your ears away from". Melody Maker stated, "No one else puts such a rocket under rap's self-consciousness or makes it so shocking".
							</p>	
							<p>
								However, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani found Eminem "repugnant" and panned his lyrics, stating "The only thing worse than Eminem's homophobia is the immaturity with which he displays it". Spin gave the album a mixed review and viewed his rhymes as "outstanding", but ultimately found its beats "mediocre" and called the album "musically, not all that noteworthy". Q stated, "True, even misdirected, Eminem's disaffection sucks you in and the wholesale nihilism can still provoke shivers. But it all used to be more fun." Although he found it too focused on Eminem's "whirlwind success" at the time, Neil Strauss of The New York Times commented that he "dissects the topic so furiously and honestly that the record stands as a fresh achievement", and concluded, "Eminem never makes it clear which character — Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers — is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there's a little bit of each character in all of us." Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times praised Eminem's "vision" and how he incorporated "personal elements" to the album, but reserved his praise by stating, "This is a four-star album that is docked a half star because of the recurring homophobia—something that may be de rigueur in commercial rap, but which still is unacceptable."
							</p>
							<p>
								In a retrospective review, Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler found the album culturally significant to American popular music and stated, "Even if you ignore the album's importance, it remains a truly special album, unique in rap's canon, owing its spirit to rock and its heritage to rap, in a way I've rarely heard". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rolling Stone journalist Cheo Hoker gave the album five out of five stars and wrote that it "delved much deeper into personal pain [than The Slim Shady LP], and the result was a minor masterpiece that merged iller-than-ill flows with a brilliant sense of the macabre."
							</p>
							<h1>Accolades</h1>
							<p>
								The album won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards.[68] It also won Best Album at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards.
								In 2003, The Marshall Mathers LP was ranked number 302 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and in its book format, the album was moved up to number 298. In 2012, it was moved up to 244, ranking it above The Slim Shady LP as Eminem's highest-placed album on the list. Rolling Stone also placed the album at number seven on its list of the best albums of the 2000s. IGN placed the album at number 24 on their 2004 list of the greatest rap albums in history. In 2006, the album was chosen by Time as one of the 100 greatest albums of all time.[In 2006, Q ranked the album number 85 on a list of the greatest albums of all time, the highest position held by any rap album on the list. It was named the fourth-greatest album of 2000's by Complex. Pitchfork Media ranked it at number 119 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s. The Marshall Mathers LP was the highest ranked rap album on the National Association of Recording Merchandisers & the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the 200 greatest albums of all time at number 28. It is one of the few albums ever to receive the top ranking of "XXL" from XXL, and Eminem's first album to be rated by the magazine. To date it has been on several lists, for instance it was placed on Vibe list of best albums since 1993.
							</p>
							<h1>Controversy</h1>
							<p>
								On October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert in Toronto's Skydome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. "I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women", he said. Flaherty claims to have been "disgusted" when reading transcriptions of Eminem's song "Kill You", which includes lines like "Slut, you think I won't choke no whore/till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?" Eminem's fans argued that this was a matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada's hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada's hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In a Globe and Mail editorial, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, "Being offensive is Eminem's job description." Eminem was granted entry into Canada.
							</p>
							<p>
								A 2001 and 2004 study by Edward Armstrong found that of the 14 songs on The Marshall Mathers LP eleven contain violent and misogynistic lyrics and nine depict killing women through choking, stabbing, drowning, shooting, head and throat splitting. According to the study, Eminem scores 78% for violent misogyny while gangsta rap music in general reaches 22%. Armstrong argues that violent misogyny characterizes most of Eminem's music and that the rapper "authenticates his self-presentations by outdoing other gangsta rappers in terms of his violent misogyny."
							</p>

								Protests against the album's content reached a climax when it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year, marking the first time a hardcore rap album was ever nominated in this category. At the ceremony, Eminem performed "Stan" in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John playing piano and singing the chorus, as a response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed his lyrics were homophobic. GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against Elton John's decision. Despite significant protests and debate, The Marshall Mathers LP went on to win Best Rap Album.
								In 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem, claiming the beat for "Kill You" was stolen from his song.

							<p>
								Devil's Night is the debut album by Detroit hip hop group D12, released on June 19, 2001.
							</p>
							<h1>Background</h1>
							<p>
								The album was executively produced by Eminem, who had recently released his hugely successful second studio album, The Marshall Mathers LP, a year earlier. The album's title comes from the Devil's Night tradition, recognized in and around Detroit in which abandoned homes are set ablaze. This practice was so popular in Detroit that it was depicted in the film 8 Mile. The album produced three singles: "Purple Pills", "Ain't Nuttin' But Music", and "Fight Music". The album featured a hidden track by Eminem called "Girls", which is a diss track aimed at Limp Bizkit, DJ Lethal, and Everlast. Devil's Night was also the first album to be released on Eminem's Shady Records label, although the label has been active since 1999. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with approximately 372,000 copies sold on the week of release.
							</p>
							<h1>Reception</h1>
							<p>
								Upon its release, Devil's Night received a score of 58 out of 100 from Metacritic due to mixed or average reviews from music critics Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars out of 5, saying that "If the Slim Shady and Marshall Mathers albums were slapstick trips into one man's psychosis - like the Marx Brothers starring in 'Taxi Driver' - then Devil's Night is 'Friday the 13th' by the Farrelly brothers....with results varying from silly to just dumb....yet its high points are some of the most accomplished hip-hop we'll hear this year.
							</p>
							<p>
								Q Magazine also awarded it 3 stars out of 5, commenting, "A slightly tweaked re-run of The Marshall Mathers LP, with a couple of stonking singles."
								NME gave Devil's Night a 7 out of 10, stating that it is "Eminem's most misogynistic, homophobic, violent and anally fixated trip to date." The Source gave the record 3 and half, out of 5 mics. As many of the magazines editors were feuding with D12 at the time of the review, namely Benzino, the rating is usually considered biased.
							</p>
							<h1>Dedication</h1>
							<p>
								The group recorded Devil's Night in memory of Bugz, who was killed in May 1999 just hours prior to a concert.
							</p>
							<h1>Notes</h1>
							<p>
								In August 2001, whilst on promotion for the album, D12 and Esham were kicked off the Warped Tour after members of the group allegedly physically attacked Esham over the lyrics of his song "Chemical Imbalance," which contained a reference to Eminem's daughter. Eminem was not present during the tour. D12, minus Eminem, recorded an appearance for Tech N9ne's 2002 album Absolute Power, on the track "She-Devil", which they originally recorded for Devil's Night. However, it failed to make the final tracklisting.
							</p>
							<p>
								The song "Revelation" parodies "Another Brick In The Wall Pt II", where there are kids screaming and Eminem shouting "Wrong! Do it again!" and "If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding! You can't have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat!". During the chorus, Eminem also parodies the original "Another Brick In The Wall", by rapping: "I don't wanna go to school, I don't need no education". The song "Girls" features a reference to Limp Bizkit's song "Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)". The song "These Drugs" is featured on the soundtrack of the horror movie Bones. On the censored version of the album, alternate versions of "Purple Pills" and "Fight Music" were included, entitled "Purple Hills" and "Flight Music". "Shit Can Happen", "Pistol Pistol", and "Pimp Like Me", were also edited, removing the offensive content from their titles. The "Dirty Edition" was available in both Europe and the United Kingdom. However, some versions swap the running order, making "Shit on You" track three and "These Drugs" track one.

								The Eminem Show is the fourth studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on May 28, 2002. It was the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States, with sales of 7.6 million copies. At the 2003 Grammy Awards it was nominated for Album of the Year and became Eminem's third LP in four years to win the award for Best Rap Album.
							</p>
							<p>
								The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling approximately 284,000 units in its first week, which due to a premature release by retailers and street-date violations, counted only a day and a half of sales. The album sold 1,322,000 copies the following week, where it registered a full week of sales. The album topped the Billboard 200 for five consecutive weeks. The album also spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart. It has gone on to sell over ten million copies. On March 7, 2011, the album was certified ten-times-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, making it Eminem's second album to receive a Diamond certification in the United States.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2009, the album was ranked #317 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and was later ranked at #84 on the same magazine's best albums of the 2000s decade. The album received critical praise by most music critics and is often debated as Eminem's most personal and best work. Eminem himself acknowledged during an interview with MTV that was recorded on May 25, 2002, that he felt that The Eminem Show was his "best record so far".[10] The Eminem Show was Eminem's first album to be mainly self-produced.
							</p>
							<h1>Release</h1>
							<p>
								The Eminem Show was first scheduled for release on June 4, 2002; however, pirated and bootleg copies appeared online on peer-to-peer networks and began surfacing on the streets. Interscope decided to release the album early on May 28 to combat bootlegging. However, many stores in the U.S. began selling it early on Sunday, May 26, and some put the album out as early as Friday. Promotional posters in stores read, "America Couldn't Wait". Due to the premature release by many retailers on a Sunday, the album had only one day of official sales for the chart week and was unavailable in Walmart stores during that period. Despite the confusion over the exact release date, the album still managed to have a very successful debut on the charts. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 284,000 copies. This marked the first time an album had topped the charts with such an abbreviated sales week. The album sold 1,322,000 copies in its first full week of sales. It sold 809,000 copies in its third week and 529,562 copies in its fourth week, to bring its four-week sales total to just under three million copies. The album sold 381,000 copies in its fifth week and topped the Billboard 200 for the fifth consecutive week. The first 2 million copies of the album shipped in the U.S. included a bonus DVD with an exclusive interview and live footage. The Eminem Show was Eminem's first album to include lyrics to all songs inside the CD booklet. It was Eminem's most successful album in terms of charting singles. It spawned two top-ten and four top fifteen singles with "Without Me", "Cleanin' Out My Closet", "Sing for the Moment" and "Superman", which managed to reach the top fifteen without a widely available video counterpart (the video was mostly available on the 8 Mile DVD, rarely being shown on music video channels). In addition, "My Dad's Gone Crazy", "Business", "Hailie's Song", and "White America" were selected airplay singles of the controversial album.
							</p>
							<h1>Content</h1>
							<p>
								The Eminem Show is a reflective album, featuring Eminem's more personal and serious side. This change gives the album a lighter tone, a departure from his previous albums. One of the most noticeable changes is the generally lighter lyrical content. Over the course of the album, he touches on the issues of race in hip hop ("White America"), his childhood ("Cleanin' Out My Closet"), the United States government and terrorism ("Square Dance"), his 2000 assault on a nightclub bouncer and his following conviction ("Soldier"), his coming to terms with fate the downside of fame ("Say Goodbye Hollywood"), his status as a rapper ("Sing for the Moment"), and his relationships with his ex-wife Kim and daughter Hailie ("Hailie's Song"). Also, the song "Say What You Say" (featuring Dr. Dre) is an attack on Jermaine Dupri and was also the first time that The Source magazine controversy was mentioned by Eminem. Unlike The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show's release came off without significant complaints about misogyny or homophobia. Some shock-oriented and extremely explicit lyrics are still present, but for the most part they are toned down. Q Magazine's May 2006 review of the album proposes "His two first albums aired dirty laundry, then the world's most celebrated rapper examined life in the hall of mirrors he'd built for himself."
							</p>
							<h1>Musical content</h1>
							<p>
								The album opens up with a skit of stage curtains apparently being opened, indicative of the "start of the show". It is followed by "White America," a song in which Eminem touches on numerous subjects ranging from his mainly white suburban youth fanbase, his own amazement at his success, and his reception by parents and politicians, it contains a rock based sound, which remains prominent throughout the album. The next track is "Business", which is a song with a light beat that touches on Eminem's success and talent. Following that is "Cleaning out My Closet" a serious song in which Eminem raps about his childhood and explains the reasons behind his distaste for his mother (some being her drug abuse, constant accusations of him stealing money, attempts to take credit for his success).
							</p>
							<p>
								"Square Dance" is next, a song which criticizes the Bush administration for its involvement regarding Iraq and the War in Afghanistan, and warns young men of being drafted. "The Kiss", a skit, follows, which is a recreation of Eminem's 2000 pistol-whipping assault of John Guerrera, a bouncer who Eminem witnessed kissing his wife, Kimberly Mathers. "Soldier" follows, criticizing lawyers, judges, and many who have insulted Eminem or hurt him in some way. This particular song was very well received by critics for its production and lyrical content. "Say Goodbye Hollywood" is the next track. Eminem raps about "selling" his soul to the devil and wanting to put an end to the fame and success because it has deadened his character and hurt his life. This song replaced his original song "Stimulate", which can be found on the 8 Mile Soundtrack: Limited Edition.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Drips" is the next song, featuring fellow Detroit rapper Obie Trice. The song follows the sexual escapades of both men and concludes with them learning they have contracted a sexually transmitted disease from the same woman. Following is "Without Me" a popular single which ridicules pop artists. "Paul Rosenberg", a skit, follows next. Paul, Eminem's manager, has left a voicemail message for the rapper upset with him after learning he has been shooting his gun behind the studio and instructing him to "leave the fucking gun at home." Following the skit is the single "Sing for the Moment", in which Eminem discusses his fame and the negative effects of it, justifies his actions and admits his mistakes, criticizes authority and hypocrisy, and concludes with Eminem voicing the opinion that his music provides a safe haven for depressed and exiled children.
							</p>
							<p>
								After is "Superman" featuring Dina Rae. The song explains Eminem's perception of women, explaining that he does not want to get involved in a relationship and does not appreciate the fact that most women are simply attracted to him because of his wealth. "Hailie's Song" is next, a song which Eminem had not planned to include on the album (but did so after Dr. Dre played the track for two female friends who were crying at the end of it). The track is mainly sung as opposed to rapped. The rapper sings the first two verses and raps the third. The entire content of the song focuses on his daughter, Hailie Jade, and his love for her. The final verse touches on his wife and how he has stayed strong through all of the issues he has encountered due to her choices, simply for his daughter.
							</p>
							<p>
								"Steve Berman", another skit, follows in which Eminem is requested to be seen. On The Marshall Mathers LP, a skit with the same title featured Berman criticizing the rapper for the lyrical content of the album. It is implied that Eminem has been called again this time for the same reason (only to say it was "the most incredible thing [he's] ever heard), but the rapper is armed with a weapon and the skit concludes with Berman being shot, unbeknownst to listeners whether he is fatally wounded. A skit on Relapse from 2009 reveals Berman survived the shot. "When The Music Stops" featuring D12, follows. The song features each rapper talking about their life and how it has been changed by their fame. "Say What You Say" is next, featuring Dr. Dre. The track insults rappers Canibus and Jermaine Dupri, whom Eminem and Dr. Dre feuded with, respectively. It also touches on Eminem and Dr. Dre's hardworking habits and ends with an insult directed at Dupri by Dr. Dre collaborator Timbaland.
							</p>
							<p>
								The next track "Till I Collapse" features Nate Dogg. Eminem also raps about the denial of his talent by many due to skin color, and criticizes the industry for untalented rappers being popular while those he perceives as having true skill are not popular. The next track is "My Dad's Gone Crazy" featuring Eminem's daughter Hailie Jade (who was 6 years old at the time of recording). The song is comical and opens up with Eminem presumably snorting lines of cocaine when his daughter interrupts him and the song kicks off. Eminem intended for the song to convey that he is not concerned with the opinions of others regarding his seemingly unrestrained mouth, as evidence by the line in the song "I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue."
							</p>
							<p>
								The album closes with "Curtain Close" similar to the opening skit, in which the curtains are now being drawn, indicating the "end of the show." Ken Kaniff, Eminem's fictional gay character, is reintroduced briefly at the end of the skit and sings a ballad with homosexual undertones to the tune of the song "Without Me" by changing the words at the beginning of the song.
							</p>
							<h1>Production</h1>
							<p>
								Production for the album took place between 2001 and 2002. Eminem had started recording the album around the same time he was filming 8 Mile. Production was used for both the soundtrack of the movie and his album. The album also saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with longtime collaborator Jeff Bass co-producing several tracks (mainly the eventual singles), and playing a significant role in co-writing many of the tracks. Dr. Dre, in addition to being the album's executive producer, produced three individual tracks: "Business", "Say What You Say", and "My Dad's Gone Crazy". In an interview with The Face magazine in April 2002, Eminem said that he treated the album like it was a rock record, in terms of production, incorporating the use of guitars while still having elements of hip-hop. He said that he wanted to capture the '70s rock vibe, which he felt "had this incredible feel", for most of the record. He said that he "tried to get the best of both worlds" on the album.[16]
							</p>
							<h1>Censored version</h1>
							<p>
								The clean version of The Eminem Show censors all profanities, compared to his previous albums, in which the words "goddamn", "prick", "bastard", "piss", "bitch", "ass", and "shit" were allowed. This album allowed no profanities, and the profanities were either muted or back masked.[citation needed] Following this, the censored version even took out entire sentences because they were too sexually charged. In fact, the entire song "Drips" is removed in the clean version and is just heard as four seconds of silence moving on to "Without Me", due to thinking there were so many profanities that editing the song would be pointless. But some copies feature an edited version of "Drips." However, in the skit "The Kiss", it can still be clearly heard that Eminem shouts "Motherfucker!" on the censored version. In "Soldier" which is a continuation of "The Kiss" the word "bitch" was used three times, but was still heard only once. "Hailie's Song" censors "want her" as it sounded too much "abort her" when he says "God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't want her" [17] on both explicit and clean versions. Also, in "White America", in Eminem's speech the word "flag" is backmasked when he says "To burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker". When a clean version of "Drips" was made, at the end of Obie Trice's verse the word "fuck" is still heard.
							</p>
							<h1>Critical reception</h1>
							<p>
								Critical response to The Eminem Show was generally positive. It was viewed by many critics and fans as a growth in Eminem as an artist. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 20 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Alex Needham from NME gave it a positive review, calling it a "fantastic third album" that "is bigger, bolder and far more consistent than its predecessors". In his review at AllMusic, Stephen Erlewine said the album "proves Eminem is the gold standard in pop music in 2002, delivering stylish, catchy, dense, funny, political music that rarely panders".
							</p>
							<p>
								With a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani said The Eminem Show "reveals a little bit of the real Marshall Mathers" that "displays a—dare I say it?—more 'mature' Eminem." And he called "Without Me" "a pop-friendly ditty that displays enough of Eminem's talent for tight rhymes and well-timed controversy to validate his perpetual upward climb."
								David Browne at Entertainment Weekly concluded, "[l]ike its predecessors, though, The Eminem Show is a testament to the skills of its star. The sludgy rapping of such guests as D12 only confirms Eminem's dizzying prowess, gob-spewing individuality, and wickedly prankish humor." He gave it a grade of B+.
							</p>
							<p>
								Robert Christgau gave the album an A- and said "I like it and I enjoy it; I think it represents an articulate, coherent, formally appropriate response to Eminem's changing position and role, one that acknowledges the privileges and alienations that accrue to all fame as well as the resolution of Marshall Mathers's worst traumas and the specifics of his success." Uncut said "Behind the hype and the swagger, he's still baring enough of his soul for The Eminem Show to be compelling theatre.
							</p>
							<p>
								The reviewer at HipHopDX admired both the musical and lyrical aspects of the work, and gave a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars: "Em flows on beat so effortlessly and naturally you'd swear it was his everyday style. Overlooking his lyrics would be a crime though." RapReviews gave it a rating of 8 out of 10 and Rolling Stone gave it a 4-star rating. It has been deemed a classic by XXL and Complex.
							</p>
							<p>
								The record became Eminem's third to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and also swept the MTV Music Video Awards, winning four awards for Best Male Video, Video of the Year, Best Direction, and Best Rap Video. It won Album of the Year & R&B/Hip-Hop Album of the Year at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards. It won Best International Album and International Album of the Year at the Brit Awards and the Juno Awards respectively in 2003.It also won Best Album at the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards.

								D12 World is the second studio album by Detroit hip hop group D12, released on April 27, 2004. The album sold 544,000 copies in its first week on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album is the last D12 album to feature Proof before his death in 2006, and the second D12 album to feature "Bugz" on a track.
							</p>
							<h1>Background</h1>
							<p>
								In memory of Bugz, who was killed prior to a concert on May 21, 1999, the group recorded the track "Good Die Young" in memory of him. The album also includes a song entitled "Bugz '97", which is a 1997 recording of Bugz, originally taken from the song "Desperados". The album was often overshadowed by Eminem's massive success, and as such, the band toured without him for promotion of the album. At the time, Eminem was busy recording Encore. Although shadowed by Eminem's success, members Bizarre and Proof managed to prevail with mildly successful solo careers following D12 World, with the releases of Hannicap Circus and Searching for Jerry Garcia in 2005. Before the album's release, "6 in the Morning" was featured on Eminem's 2003 mixtape Straight from the Lab and was entitled "Come On In".
							</p>
							<h1>Reception</h1>
							<p>
								D12 World debuted at the top of the U.S., U.K., Irish, Canadian and NZ album charts. It debuted at number 2 in Germany and Australia, and also in the top 5 in Switzerland, Norway and Australia. It debuted in the top 10 in Sweden, Denmark, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. It sold over 500,000 records in its first week of release in the United States alone. "My Band", the first single, also has been successful reaching number one in Australia and the U.S. rhythmic top 40, top 5 in the U.K. and Germany and top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Upon release, D12 World received mixed to positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 58, based on 13 reviews, which indicates "mixed or average reviews."

							<h1> Content </h1>
							<p>
								Encore (stylized as ƎNCORE) is the fifth studio album by American rapper Eminem. Its release was set for November 16, 2004, but was moved up to November 12 (coincidentally, exactly eight years to the day his debut album, Infinite, was released) after the album was leaked to the Internet. Encore sold 710,000 copies in its first three days, and went on to sell over 1.5 million copies in its first two weeks of release in the United States,[2] certified quadruple-platinum that mid-December. Nine months after its release, worldwide sales of the album stood at 11 million copies. Critical reception was generally positive. However, most critics and fans alike did note the subpar quality of the lyrics, which were more simplistic when compared to his previous albums. The album was nominated for three Grammys at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards including for Best Rap Album but lost to Kanye West's Late Registration. The album made digital history in becoming the first album to sell 10,000 digital copies in one week. 
								As of November 2013, the album has sold 5,343,000 copies.
							</p>
							<h1>Censorship</h1>
							<p>
								In "We As Americans", the line "Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents, I'd rather see the president dead" has "dead" censored with a DJ scratch in "See the president dead" on both clean and explicit versions of the album. Simultaneously with the original, a censored version was released, from which the profanities, violent and sexual content, as well the drug references had been edited.
							</p>
							<p>
								"My 1st Single" has a bleep instead of a muted part in the verse "This was supposed to be my first single, but I just fucked that up so... Fuck it let's all have fun lets mingle" like the clean version of "The Real Slim Shady". The word "ass" is left uncensored in "Yellow Brick Road", "One Shot 2 Shot", "Encore" and "We As Americans", but is censored out in "Ass Like That", "Mosh", "Spend Some Time", "My 1st Single", and "Just Lose It", and also in the song "Rain Man", the word "ass" was used twice, but only censored once. The word "goddamn" was left uncensored in "Spend Some Time." In the "clean" version's album booklet, the written lyrics have been removed, however on the songs "Puke", "My 1st Single" and "Just Lose It", lyrics were changed to avoid long censorship. Other profanities on all other songs are blanked out; and the song "Ass Like That" is listed as "A** Like That". The song "Encore/Curtains Down" has the shooting sequence at the end of the track removed on the censored album. Also, on the track "One Shot 2 Shot", the intro to the song is removed and the song starts at the first chorus, with more lines blanked out during the remainder of the track. Also, in "One Shot 2 Shot", during Kon Artis' verse, the word "fuck" was left uncensored.
							</p>
							<h1>Artwork</h1>
							<p>
								The album featured two covers, the first cover features Eminem standing in front of an audience, bowing to the crowd. The tray insert features Eminem holding a gun behind his back. The inlay shows Eminem holding the pistol in his mouth without the jacket of his shirt and tie. The CD itself shows a note written by Eminem saying "To my family & All my friends, thank you for everything, I will Always love you. To my fans, I'm Sorry, Marshall" with a bullet underneath the note. The note is also seen in the album's booklet, where Eminem is writing the note. Some pictures show Eminem shooting everybody, which makes a reference to the ending of the album's title track. The second cover features the same audience from the inlay on a black background with a blood splat on the top right. This cover is used for the Shady Collecter's Edition
							</p>
							<h1>Reception</h1>
							<p>
								Upon its release, Encore received positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 26 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".
							</p>
							<p>
								AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine opined that Encore shares similar subject themes as its predecessor The Eminem Show. He called the music "spartan", built on "simple unadorned beats and keyboard loops" and described the lyrics as "plain-spoken and literal". Robert Christgau, in a review for The Village Voice, gave the album an A grade and characterized it as "funny, catchy and clever", highlighting the bonus tracks as the record's "high point". Writing for Rolling Stone, the same author said that Encore wasn't as "astonishing" as his previous studio albums, but praised Eminem for maturing his lyrical abilities. Steve Jones from USA Today also spoke positively about the album, calling Eminem's producing and lyrical skills as "top-flight" and noting that the record explores "the many sides of Marshall Mathers".
							</p>
							<p>
								However, not all reviews were so enthusiastic. Josh Love, writing in Stylus Magazine, felt that Eminem was "dying" with this album. He further said that the concept was "end-to-end mea culpa", full of "clarifications, rectifications and excuses", revising the history of "a man who knows he doesn't have much time left". Scott Plangenhoef from Pitchfork Media called Encore a "transitional record", further saying that the LP is "the sound of a man who seems bored of re-branding and playing celebrity games". Pete Cashmore, writing in NME, stated that this was Marshall's "retirement speech" because he seemed "intent on bringing ongoing disputes to a close". By contrast, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that Encore was "part of Eminem's evolution as an artist". He defended Eminem's repetitive lyrics by saying that the essence of an encore is "to sate the demand of an audience", not to "satisfy the artist's compulsion to create something new".[15] BBC Music's Adam Webb observed that Encore starts "fantastically" but ends "abominably". He criticized the album for having too many "lowpoints" and for failing to be Eminem's In Utero. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly said that Eminem "sacrifices the rich, multi-textured productions" of his two previous albums for "thug-life monotony, cultural zingers for petty music-biz score-settling, and probing self-analysis for juvenile humor". He concluded his review by saying that Eminem has become "predictable" on Encore, something that he wasn't before.
							</p>
							<p>
								The album did provoke some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Michael Jackson, who was upset about Eminem's depiction of him in the video for "Just Lose It". On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service admitted it was "looking into" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States, George Bush, after the song "We as Americans", as an unreleased bootleg, circulated with the lyrics "Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead." This line was eventually used as a sample in Immortal Technique's single "Bin Laden", which featured Mos Def and Chuck D. The incident was later referenced in the video for his song "Mosh" as one several news clips on a wall, along with other newspaper articles about other unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. The song eventually appeared on the album's bonus disc, where the lyrics were extensively censored.
							</p>
							<h1>Accolades</h1>
							<p>
								The album earned Eminem three Grammy Award nominations at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards: these included Best Rap Album, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for the song "Encore" and Best Rap Solo Performance for the song "Mockingbird". However, it did not win any of them, making it the only Eminem major studio album not to win a Best Rap Album award.
							</p>
							<h1>Notes</h1>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>"Love You More" and the original version of "We As Americans" (titled "We Are Americans") appear on the Straight from the Lab mixtape released in 2003</li>
									<li>Dr. Dre has cameo appearances in "Rain Man", "Just Lose It", "Ass Like That", "Mockingbird" and "Like Toy Soldiers"</li>
									<li>50 Cent also had a cameo with Dr. Dre in "Like Toy Soldiers"</li>
									<li>This is Eminem's first album, other than Infinite (1996), to not have Ken Kaniff and Steve Berman skits. They both reappear in Relapse (2009).</li>
									<li>"Curtains Down" is a skit at the end of "Encore/Curtains Down", which Eminem shoots everyone at his concert and shoots himself and a robotic voice saying "See you in hell, fuckers" is used. Some of the pictures in the booklet make reference to this.</li>

							Relapse is the sixth studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on May 15, 2009 by Interscope Records. It was his first album of original material since Encore (2004), following a four-year hiatus from recording due to his writer's block and an addiction to prescription sleeping medication. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2007 to 2009 at several recording studios, and Dr. Dre, Mark Batson, and Eminem handled production. Conceptually, Relapse concerns the ending of his drug rehabilitation, rapping after a non-fictional relapse, and the return of his Slim Shady alter-ego.

							One of the most anticipated album releases of 2009, Relapse debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 608,000 copies in its first week. It produced three singles that attained chart success and has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album received mixed reviews from most music critics, who were divided in their responses towards Eminem's lyrics. It sold more than two million copies in the United States and more than five million copies worldwide.

						<h1>Background</h1>
						<p>
							Since 2005, Eminem intended to take a break from recording his own music to become a hip hop producer for other rap acts, especially for the artists signed on his own label Shady Records. However, Eminem entered his hiatus after cancelling the European leg of the Anger Management Tour in the summer of 2005 because of exhaustion and an addiction to prescription sleeping drugs. In the following year, the rapper's remarriage to his former wife Kimberly Scott lasted only eleven weeks before a second divorce, while his closest friend and fellow rapper DeShaun "Proof" Holton was later shot and killed during an altercation outside a Detroit nightclub. Devastated, Eminem relapsed into prescription drug abuse and became increasingly reclusive. In a June 2009 interview for XXL, Eminem elaborated on the impact of Proof's death on him, stating:
							"Everyone felt [Proof's] loss, from his kids, to his wife, to everyone. But, for some reason, in hindsight, the way I felt was almost like it happened to just me... Maybe at the time I was a little bit selfish with it. I think it kind of hit me so hard. It just blindsided me. I just went into such a dark place that, with everything, the drugs, my thoughts, everything. And the more drugs I consumed, and it was all depressants I was taking, the more depressed I became, the more self-loathing I became...""
						</p>
						<p>
							Speculation on an upcoming album by Eminem was reported since mid–2007 from announcements made by artists 50 Cent and Stat Quo, a current and former member of Shady Records respectively. Also, rapper Bizarre – a member of the hip hop group D12 – stated that the release of the group's third studio album was on hold because Interscope Records wanted to release Eminem's album first. By the end of the year, additional musicians associated with Shady Records – including The Alchemist, Bishop Lamont, Cashis and Obie Trice – had confirmed on different occasions that the rapper was effectively working on a new album. On September 12, 2007, during a call at the radio station WQHT Hot 97, Eminem stated that he was in limbo and was not sure whether he would release any new material in the near future. He then elaborated that at that point he was constantly working in the recording studio and had come to terms with his personal issues. However, in December 2007, he was hospitalized because of an overdose of methadone. In early 2008, he began a 12-step program to recover from his addiction; in a later interview, he said he has been sober since April 20, 2008.

						<h1>Recording</h1>
						<p>
							In the initial recording stages of Relapse, record producer and long-time Detroit collaborator Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers worked with Eminem on 25 tracks, two years after the rapper had received treatment for his sleeping pill addiction in 2005. Depressed by Proof's death, Eminem fell into a period of "writer's block", where he felt everything he wrote was not worth recording. To compensate for this, Bass chose to follow a production style that would allow the artist to rap "off the top of his head, as opposed to writing a story". Eminem would then freestyle or record vocals one line at a time before interrupting and then recording another line. At the same time, according to Eminem's song rights supervisor Joel Martin, the rapper began to collect additional songs without noticing it. He would often record or produce material initially intended for the musical projects of other artists, but end up with tracks he really liked. "Beautiful", produced by Eminem, was the only song on Relapse that was recorded in these years while he was not sober.
						</p>
						<p>
							Eminem purchased the Effigy Studio in Ferndale, Michigan, in 2007, and ended his working relationship with much of his former production team of the 54 Sound recording studio, including the Bass Brothers. In September 2007, Dr. Dre stated his intention to dedicate two months to the production of Relapse. Working with Dr. Dre allowed Eminem to concentrate on the processes of songwriting rather than the production, which was largely taken care of by Dre. The rapper justified his choice of using Dr. Dre for the vast majority of the production due to their long collaborative history and a musical "chemistry" only he and Dr. Dre shared. This allowed the rapper to pick the beats from Dr. Dre's catalog that challenged him rhythm-wise to experiment with different flows. The making of the album progressed at the Effigy Studio up to a year after, as recording sessions were then moved to Orlando, Florida in September 2008. By then, Eminem had begun to start writing verses again at such a pace that he often took more time to record the lyrics than write them. He credited sobriety for his new creative run, acknowledging that his mind was free of the clutter that "blocked" him during his drug abuse in the last years. Dr. Dre would start the song-writing process by giving a number of his beats on a CD to Eminem, who in a separate room in the studio would listen and select the ones he preferred and inspired him the most. Eminem would then write lyrics to the instrumentals, while Dr. Dre and his production staff continued to create new music. Once he felt he had written lyrics for enough songs, Eminem would dedicate an entire day to record his songs to the point that he would lose his voice for the following days. At that point, the rapper would then begin to write lyrics for new songs. The process continued for the next six months and allowed Eminem to have enough material also for a second album Relapse 2.
						</p>
						<p>
							During this recording period, a handful of songs intended for Relapse were leaked on the Internet, including an incomplete version of "Crack a Bottle". The song was finished in January 2009 and featured vocals from Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. Despite the leak, the album was being completed in a state of near-total secrecy, according to the British newspaper The Independent. Even Polydor Records, the multinational owner of Interscope, had no information on the album at the time. On April 23, Eminem suggested he and possibly Dr. Dre were the only ones in possession of the final copy of Relapse; his manager Paul Rosenberg added that even Eminem's record labels were not in possession of the music less than a month before its release to prevent possible bootlegging.

						<h1>Music</h1>
						<p>
							In an interview for XXL, Eminem described the concept behind Relapse to be the ending of his drug rehabilitation and thus rap as if he was on drugs again, as well as the return of his fictional alter-ego Slim Shady. According to the interviewer Datwon Thomas, Eminem's influences for the album came from his own past drug issues and from television shows and documentaries involving crime and serial killers, as the rapper was fascinated by "serial killers and their psyche and their mind stat In a May 2009 interview for The New York Times, Eminem discussed his view of serial killers, stating:
							"You listen to these people talk, or you see them, they look so regular. What does a serial killer look like? He don’t look like anything. He looks like you. You could be living next door to one. If I lived next door to you, you could be."
						</p>
						<p>
							Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the opening line to the album featuring the phrase "horror corridor" as Eminem telling listeners that it is a horrorcore album.[29] Ben Kaplan of the Vancouver Courier also categorized it as a horrorcore album. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times said that the album's "horrorcore scenes" show Eminem as "a madman created by the hypocrisy of therapy."
						</p>
						<h1>Content</h1>
						<p>
							Relapse opens with the skit "Dr. West", where actor Dominic West voices a drug counselor whose untrustworthiness causes Eminem to fall back to drugs and the return to his Slim Shady character. The skit leads to "3 a.m.", where Eminem depicts himself as a serial killer during a murder spree.[33][34] When "3 a.m." was released as a single prior to the album's own release, Eminem noted that the song closely mirrored what he believed was the overall dark tone of the album. On "My Mom", the rapper traces his addictive tendencies to his mother and shows how he became a drug addict just like her. Eminem continues his family tales on "Insane", where he imagines himself as a victim of child molestation. For Eminem, the goal of "Insane" was to make song that would disgust the listeners and "make them puke", adding that he came up with this idea after thinking of the song's first line ("I was born with a dick in my brain/Yeah, fucked in the head"). Mariah Carey and her current husband Nick Cannon are targeted in "Bagpipes from Baghdad", where Eminem raps over a pungi loop.
						</p>
						<p>
							After "Hello", where Eminem re-introduces himself after years of being absent "mentally", he continues his violent fantasies on "Same Song & Dance", where he abducts and murders Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears. The upbeat rhythm of "Same Song & Dance" reminded Eminem of a dance track, which inspired him to write something in order to "get women to dance to it and not really know what the fuck they're dancing to" without listening to the lyrics. On the ninth track of the album, "We Made You", Eminem mocks several celebrities and plays the role of a "pop star serial killer". Eminem noted that his various "celebrity bashings" were not meant to be seen as personal attacks, but it was rather "picking names out of a hat" that rhymed with the words he wanted to use during the writing process.[39] On "Medicine Ball" Eminem mocks and impersonates deceased actor Christopher Reeve in order to get his audience to "laugh at it, and then almost feel bad for laughing". The next track is "Stay Wide Awake", which Eminem raps about assaulting and raping women. Dr. Dre also has a guest appearance on "Old Time's Sake", a duet Eminem described as a "fun, yet reminiscent record old times" in which he and Dre rap back and forth between each other, advocating the use of marijuana for creative and financial benefits. Song "Must Be the Ganja" follows, where Eminem raps that working in the recording studio is like a drug and an addiction for him.
						</p>
						<p>
							After the skit "Mr. Mathers", where Eminem is recovered to a hospital, "Déjà Vu" addresses his overdose in 2007 and drug dependency during his hiatus from music. On the song, Eminem also explains how this has affected him in the last five years, to the point where his daughter has become scared of her father's behavior. "Beautiful", a ballad which samples "Reaching Out" by Rock Therapy, also deals with the same time period where Eminem believed he had "reached rock bottom" and lost hope for his future. Eminem felt it was important to include "Beautiful" on the album as a reminder to himself as well as "anybody who is in a dark place [...] that you can get out of it". After "Crack a Bottle", a collaboration with Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, Relapse ends with "Underground". On this final track, Eminem sought to bring back to his music and lyrics the subject matter and punchlines reminiscent of "The Hiphop Shop times" (The Hiphop Shop was a clothing store in Detroit where local rappers, including Eminem, would compete in freestyle battles[41]), before he had become famous and thus did not have worry about the explicit content of his lyrics.
						</p>
						<h1>Relapse: Refill and Relapse 2</h1>
						<p>
							Because Eminem recorded far more material than he could use for one album and felt that he had to offer his fans more music after staying on hiatus for so long, fellow D12 member Swift confirmed that Eminem in fact had planned to put out two albums the same year, following with Relapse 2, in late 2009. According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 was to be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview, Eminem confirmed: "It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it." Eminem also explained the album was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, "[just] rap records". Guest appearances were expected to come from the likes of Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Royce da 5'9", Lloyd Banks and Cashis. The album was subsequently pushed back for an early 2010 release, so Eminem decided to re-release Relapse as Relapse: Refill with seven new tracks, including the single "Forever" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack) and "Taking My Ball" (released with DJ Hero), as well as five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year."
						</p>
						<p>
							On April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted "There is no Relapse 2", thus announcing that the album has been scrapped in favor of his new project Recovery. While recording Relapse 2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result did not seem to him as continuation of Relapse but more of an individual project that deserved its own name. Eminem said: "I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title." The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000 copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000 copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.
						</p>
						<h1>Release and promotion</h1>
						<p>
							In 2007, Shady Records rapper Cashis discussed the album, referring to it by the title King Mathers and adding that it would be released later that year. However, Eminem's publicist Dennis Dennehy would later deny this and stated that "there [was] no album scheduled for a 2007 release" and that, as of August 2007, there was no confirmed title. No other official statement was made for over a year. It was not until September 15, 2008, at an event held by Shade 45 to celebrate the publication of Eminem's autobiography The Way I Am, the rapper confirmed his plans to release a studio album by the title of Relapse. During the party, he also previewed to the audience a song called "I'm Having a Relapse".
						</p>
						<p>
							In regards to the album's release date, Rolling Stone wrote in its October 2008 issue that Virgin Megastores had planned to distribute Relapse on November 27, 2008 in the United States. On October 27, a spokesperson for Interscope explained that there was no official date at the time, and that any release dates that had been posted on any website were unfounded. In a phone conversation during the finale of Total Request Live on November 16, 2008, Eminem asserted that Relapse would be released during the first quarter of 2009, precisely during either of the first two months of the year, explaining that he was in the process of selecting the songs for the album.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite the leak two months before, "Crack a Bottle" was eventually released for legal paid digital download as well as a promotional single on February 2, 2009, and also reached the number one position on the US Billboard Hot 100; according to Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg, a music video for the song had been produced and directed by Syndrome and was released in several parts of the world from May to early June. At the time of the release, various contradicting reports disputed whether the song would be included on Relapse, but a press release from head label Universal Music Group confirmed the single's inclusion on the album. In similar press statements after March 5, Universal made public the regional release dates for Relapse: as early as May 15, 2009, in Italy and the Netherlands; most other European countries and Brazil on May 18; and the following day in the United States and Australia. Additionally, the record label also announced a second album by Eminem, then called Relapse 2 but later titled Recovery, which was to be released by the end of the year, but expected in June 2010. Eminem explained that he and Dr. Dre had recorded a considerable amount of music and thus, by releasing two albums, would allow listeners to have access to all of his music.
						</p>
						<p>
							After the release of "Crack a Bottle", the music video of the single "We Made You" was aired on April 7, and became available for purchase a week later on April 13. The video was directed by Joseph Kahn and premiered simultaneously on several MTV channels as well as MTV's website. On April 28, the third overall single for the album, "3 a.m.", was released again for paid music download. A music video for "3 a.m." was directed by Syndrome and filmed in Detroit. It premiered on May 2 on Cinemax, several days after a trailer for the video was posted online. Two more singles were distributed prior to the album's release, as "Old Time's Sake" and "Beautiful" went on sale on the iTunes Store on May 5 and May 12 respectively. "My Darling" and "Careful What You Wish For" were made available upon purchase of the Premium version of the album. The track "Insane" peaked at position 85 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on the album's release via iTunes.
						</p>
						<p>
							On April 4, 2009, CBS featured Eminem during the network's coverage of the 2009 NCAA Final Four in a segment where he recited the spoken word "Love Letter to Detroit". Later on the same day, the rapper inducted the hip hop group Run-D.M.C. to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Adam Graham of The Detroit News described this as "all part of the calculated promotional push" for Relapse. The rapper performed live at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards on May 31, while he appeared on the covers of hip hop magazines Vibe and XXL in their respective issues in June 2009; the latter was created by a deal struck with Eminem and Marvel Comics, where the rapper would pose as Marvel's main vigilante The Punisher. Marvel created an issue of the comic co-starring Eminem. An iPhone game to accompany the album was released on May 19, 2009.
						</p>
						<p>
							While on the Never Say Never tour, fellow group members Swifty and Kuniva (D12) along with Royce Da 5'9" stopped by KISS 100FM for a live interview and spoke on Relapse. Royce stated that the album will be a game changer and jokingly said he might have to push his own album back three years after Eminem drops his. Kuniva added that D12 recorded many tracks for Relapse but wasn't sure if they would make the album or not. Swifty then confirmed that Eminem would be dropping two albums in 2009, with Relapse 2 following Relapse. Relapse was re-released on December 21, 2009, as Relapse: Refill, with seven bonus tracks and including the single "Forever" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack), "Taking My Ball" (released with DJ Hero), and five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year".
						</p>
						<h1>Artwork</h1>
						<p>
							The album cover for Relapse was first published through Eminem's Twitter account on April 21, 2009. It illustrates a head shot of the rapper composed by a mosaic of thousands of pills. A sticker on the cover resembles a prescription drug label, on which the patient is Eminem and the prescribing doctor is Dr. Dre. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described the cover as a reference to the rapper's struggle and addiction to prescription drugs, adding that it follows Eminem's habit of displaying personal issues in his art. The album booklet and back cover follow a pill prescription design. On the backside of the booklet is a dedication to Proof, where Eminem explains that he's sober and that he tried to write a song for him, but that he didn't find one of them good enough therefore he dedicates the whole album to him. The CD itself is meant to represent the lid on a bottle of prescription pills, grey with the big red inscription "Push Down & Turn". The cover for Relapse: Refill is the same, with the background color changed from black to white. The prescription drug label is scratched out and the writing "Refill" is posed next to it.

						<h1>Commercial performance</h1>

							One of the most anticipated albums of 2009, Relapse was the top-selling hip hop album of the year. Upon its release, the album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 608,000 copies in its first week.[86] In Canada, the album sold 64,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart. Outside of North America, Relapse managed to reach the number one spot in its first week in various other countries including Australia, France, Norway, Denmark and New Zealand, while climbing into the Top 5 in many other countries, including Germany, Italy, Finland, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden. In its second week the album stayed at number one and sold a further 211,000 copies, taking its total to 819,000 to become the fifth best-seller of the year.

						</p>
						<p>
							Relapse became the best selling rap album of 2009. Relapse had sold more than two million copies in the US. The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on August 27, 2010. By June 2010, it had sold more than 5 million copies worldwide. Relapse has sold more than 2,335,000 units to date in the United States.
						</p>
						<h1>Critical reception</h1>
						<p>
							Relapse received generally mixed reviews from music critics.[111][112] It holds an aggregate score of 59, based on 27 reviews, at Metacritic. Despite calling it an "impressively focused and clever work", Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers felt the music was "not transcendent" and commented that "Eminem could have pulled his music into a new category. What he presents is still powerful, but narrowly cast". Andy Gill of The Independent found the album to be "drably repetitive, while its dated tone is emphasised by the return of Dr Dre as producer." NME's Louis Pattison found Eminem's wordplay "wicked in the depths of its depravity", but felt that "the overriding feel is of an album just too jaded, too joyless to truly count as a return to form". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson viewed that "the further Relapse strays from narrative veracity, the more one suspects his fanbase feels he's tapping into his bottomless well for horror-show grandstanding." The Times called Relapse "an album that sits square between what Eminem is theoretically still capable of and what we feared he has become." Nathan Rabin, writing in The A.V. Club, panned it as "facile pre-adolescent shock mixed with gory, corpse-strewn, Fangoria-damaged horrorcore."[103] MSN Music's Robert Christgau called it a "dud" and accused Eminem of sensationalism: "this is not a Slim Shady album. Slim Shady had a lightness about him".[104]
						</p>
						<p>
							In a positive review, Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield called the album a "more painful, honest and vital record", viewing it as on-par with Eminem's acclaimed fourth album The Eminem Show. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described the album as "musically white-hot, dense, and dramatic" and said that "his flow is so good, his wordplay so sharp, it seems churlish to wish that he addressed something other than his long-standing obsessions and demons".[36] The Daily Telegraph commended its honest depiction of Eminem's drug addiction and overuse.[115] Although he found its concept "spotty", Vibe's Benjamin Meadows-Ingram praised Eminem's lyricism, writing that "Em works wonders with words, expanding the boundaries of the art of rap itself [...] the composition is experimental and abstract, a master toying with form".[116] At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.
						</p>
						<h1>Retrospect</h1>
						<p>
							On his following album Recovery (2010), Eminem made reference to Relapse and criticizes it in the second verse of the song "Not Afraid": "In fact, let's be honest/ That last Relapse CD was 'ehh'/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going back to that now".
							He slowed down his feelings about the album after that saying "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That was one of those instances where I got in a zone, like, “Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album.” And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at."[119] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q&A with Rolling Stone saying "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like "Ha ha this is funny!" You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the ground. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2013, Eminem also addressed the mindstate he had while working on 2009's Relapse saying: "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I was still trying to figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." and reiterated his feeling about the album "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through to be able to make Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again."

						<p>
							Recovery is the seventh studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on June 18, 2010, by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records as the follow-up to Eminem's Relapse (2009). Originally planned to be released as Relapse 2, the album was renamed to Recovery when Eminem found the music of the new album different from its predecessor.
						</p>
						<p>
							Production of the album took place during 2009 to 2010 at several recording studios and was handled by various record producers, including Alex da Kid, Just Blaze, Boi-1da, Jim Jonsin, DJ Khalil, Mr. Porter and Dr. Dre. Eminem also collaborated with artists such as Pink, Lil Wayne and Rihanna for the album. Recovery featured more introspective and emotional content than its predecessor and the theme of the album revolved around his positive changes, anxiety, and emotional drives. For the promotion of the album, he featured in TV shows and performed the album's songs live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, musical events and also headed The Recovery Tour.
						</p>
						<p>
							The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Eminem's rapping and performance on the album, although some criticized its inconsistency and production. Recovery debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 741,000 copies in its first week and stayed at number one for seven non-consecutive weeks. It also peaked inside the top ten of several other countries and was the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide. By October 2011, the album had sold approximately 10 million copies worldwide. Recovery has earned Eminem American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Detroit Music Awards and Grammy Awards, while it was nominated at Brit Awards, Juno Awards and MTV Video Music Awards Japan.
						</p>
						<p>
							The lead single "Not Afraid", released on April 29, 2010, sold 380,000 digital downloads in its first week debuting at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and earned Eminem a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance. "Love The Way You Lie" featuring Rihanna reached the top spot in over 20 countries and stayed at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks. With sales of over 5 million in the United States and 10.25 million worldwide, it became Eminem's best selling single to date. He collaborated with Lil Wayne for "No Love". "Space Bound" was released as the fourth and the final single. Four other unreleased songs from the album also charted on the US Billboard Hot 100.
						</p>
						<h1>Background and production</h1>
						<p>
							In a press release, Eminem explained that he and Dr. Dre had recorded a considerable amount of music while recording Relapse (2009), thus, "putting out Relapse 2 will let everyone get all of the best stuff." According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 was to be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview Eminem also confirmed "It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it."[3] He called into Shade 45 and said he was in the studio finishing up the album. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2009 to 2010 at several recording studios, including Allure Sound in Oak Park, Michigan, 54 Sound and Effigy Studios in Ferndale, Michigan, Black Chiney Studios in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, Boi-1da Studio in Ajax, Ontario, Canada, Playhouse in Parkland, Florida, Avex Honolulu Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii, Encore Studios in Burbank, California, Sun Studios in Temple Bar, Dublin, and Shake 'Em Down Studios in Queens, New York City.
						</p>
						<p>
							When premiering his debut single, "Not Afraid", Eminem also let listeners know that "there were not any skits on the album" (so the album would contain more songs than his previous studio albums).[He described a song titled "Insult to Injury", in which Eminem performs in his normal voice, as a sequel to "Underground," the final track from the previous album, Relapse. A song on the album "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" featured his rap group D12. Bizarre of D12 said the new song shows the group's strength despite the death of founder Proof by stating: "We're still family, but everybody's got their own situations going on," he added. "No matter what y'all do, you can't hold D12 down. We've been through a lot of shit, but we're still gonna come back and recover."
						</p>
						<p>
							As for guests on the album, Eminem had said back while the album was still titled Relapse 2, he worked with both Dr. Dre and 50 Cent on the album. D12, Royce da 5'9", Lloyd Bank and Cashis had been speculated as possible features on the album. However, none of these artists are actually featured; Recovery only featured guest appearances by rapper Lil Wayne and solo singers Kobe, Pink and Rihanna. He decided to include Pink on "Won't Back Down" after recording his parts first because he "felt like she would smash this record". On the bonus track "Session One", Eminem features supergroup Slaughterhouse, signed with Shady Records. DJ Whoo Kid heard some songs from the album and stated that "The Warning" is a diss record to Mariah Carey, and was not as intense as the entire album would be, saying the album is 'maniacal'. Eminem appeared on Shade 45 with DJ Whoo Kid where he stated that a track with 50 Cent, in which the two rap together on verses, existed. He also confirmed both Just Blaze and Mr. Porter as producers of the album.
						</p>
						<p>
							In June 2009, Eminem said that he expected the release of his new album during the fourth quarter of 2009. It was slated to be the second Eminem album released in 2009, after Relapse, but was pushed back to 2010. In November 2009, he stated that he would re-release Relapse, with extra songs, to hold fans over for the release of Relapse 2 in 2010[15] and was voted as the most anticipated album of fall 2009 by XXL. In an interview with Billboard, he said that he would listen to his previous releases like The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show and Encore, and would "ask [himself], 'Why don't my music feel like this anymore?'" He later recorded material that could constitute three or four studio albums and stated that; "I must have gone through 200–300 beats, for the album and chose 100 of them and recorded it."
						</p>
						<h1>Themes and composition</h1>
						<p>
							The album was dedicated "2 anyone who's in a dark place tryin' 2 get out. Keep your head up... It does get better!" [sic] Eminem, in an interview with Billboard, described that he was in "full-blown addiction" at the time of recording Encore, while he felt happy and "first got sober" during recording Relapse as he was no more an addict. However, he felt that while recording Relapse, he was not "paying attention to what the average listener might like or not like." Just Blaze, the first producer of the album stated that, "[Eminem] already knew what sort of mistakes he has made with the previous album and where he wanted to go from there." Thus, Recovery was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, "[just] rap records". The album's artwork featured two covers: One with Eminem walking down a country road and another with him sitting in a transparent living room in the middle of Detroit with the Renaissance Center in the background. The album's liner featured pictures of Eminem such as a picture of him praying and him posing without a shirt on.
						</p>
						<p>
							The album opens with "Cold Wind Blows" in which Eminem sings regarding his "doomed love for his ex-wife" and on "settling scores with rival celebs". In "Talkin’ 2 Myself", he states the harm caused to his image with lyrics such as: "Encore’ I was on drugs, ‘Relapse’ I was flushing them out." "On Fire" shows "a murder-and-dismemberment fantasy" with gruesome rhymes and "Won't Back Down" which featured Pink was a heavy metal song. "W.T.P." ("White-Trash Party") sees his singing to go back to his early records with lighter and simple rhythmic frame, while "Going Through Changes", using Black Sabbath's "Changes", depicts Eminem's sorrow and shows himself being trapped due to fame. "Not Afraid" which is a mid-tempo song, focuses on a positive change from Eminem's past experiences, including an end to drug abuse, feuds and violence. Idolator commented that the song was based on the "dark days Eminem has lived through", and "he seems to be at peace with himself now." A writer for MuchMusic website noted that Eminem chose to use his Marshall Mathers ego for the song, rather than Slim Shady.
						</p>
						<p>
							"No Love" features Lil Wayne as a hype man which is followed by Eminem's verses which according to Sam Wolfson of NME are "the best verses of his career." The meaning of "Space Bound" is not obvious or completely clear and according to Sasha Grey who is featured in its video, the meaning can be interpreted "in many ways".[28] Jim Jonsin of MTV spoke about Eminem's two egos seen in the video and compared it to Alanis Morissette's "Ironic" video while Grey believed that the alternate Eminem who appears in the car is his subconscious. "Cinderella Man" with a "festive beat" had "the template of every album since Encore (2004)", with many minor keys and traces of post-grunge rock.[20] "25 to Life" shows his discomfiture and depicts that the "selfish bitch" pulling him back "these days is rap itself."[30] Despite the lyrics being tighter throughout the album, "So Bad" and "Almost Famous" views his other side of Slim Shady; his alter ego. The hip-hop ballad "Love The Way You Lie" describes a couple's refusal to separate despite having an abusive relationship. Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano, while acoustic guitar, violin and pounding drums accompany Eminem's verses. The singing of Rihanna despite of being without vibrato, her voice "shows grief and regret". Towards the end he claims his influence, by "fevered rhymes" on "You’re Never Over".
						</p>
						<h1>Release and promotion</h1>
						<p>
							Recovery was confirmed during a press release by Eminem's label on March 5, 2010, and was originally titled Relapse 2 On April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted "There is no Relapse 2" to his followers. It was followed by him tweeting "Recovery" with a link to his website. Eminem said "I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title."] He later released a freestyle titled "Despicable" over "Over" by Drake and "Beamer, Benz, or Bentley" by Lloyd Banks featuring Juelz Santana as promo for the first single, "Not Afraid", which debuted on Shade 45 on April 29. Eventually, Recovery was released on June 18 in the Europe and on June 21 in the United States and the United Kingdom.
						</p>
						<p>
							Eminem has done multiple interviews such as with Red Bull in promotion of the album. A commercial for Recovery premiered during Game 6 of the 2010 NBA Finals. It featured Vince Offer from the Slap Chop commercials in a parody of his commercials. A Call of Duty: Black Ops ad with "Won't Back Down" was released; the song also appeared in the game as an easter egg. On June 15, Eminem appeared among other artists including Usher and will.i.am for Activision's press conference during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 with Rihanna where the duo performed "Love the Way You Lie". In addition, Eminem performed "Lose Yourself", "Not Afraid", and premiered "Won't Back Down" for the first time. Eminem featured on E! during their Daily 10 show in an interview with Clinton Sparks and also appeared in a skit on The Soup. He performed songs from the album as well as his previous songs at various events such as the 2010 BET Awards, 2010 MTV Video Music Awards,[46] Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010, Bonnaroo Music Festival, T in the Park and Virgin Group's V Festival.] He also headed The Recovery Tour; a series of European, American and Australian concerts in support of the album and its predecessor Relapse.
						</p>

The song also won the award of the Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards.[60] Rolling Stone praised Eminem's commitment on his new music and lyrical ability noting "Over a dark, operatic beat, Eminem delivers rhymes that are typically acrobatic – and typically heavy-handed. But the anger has a gathering quality."
						</p>
						<p>
							The second single was released on August 9, 2010 titled "Love the Way You Lie", which featured Rihanna.[62] The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and later peaked number one.

Michael Menachem from Billboard commented that "Rihanna's chorus is exquisitely melodic and surprisingly hopeful, complementing the turmoil of Em's dark, introspective rant." The song was performed at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and was voted the best performer of the ceremony in an MTV poll, earning 34 percent of votes.
						</p>
						<p>

The video was slammed by British anti-violence campaigners.[79] Anti-violence group, Mothers Against Violence, told the Daily Mirror, "It's all about the money with these videos. Eminem isn't thinking about the families affected." The music video was then analyzed by Sasha Grey and the song's producer, Jim Jonsin who both agreed that the video had no certain message, but could be interpreted "in many ways".

						</p>
						<h1>Critical reception</h1>
						<p>
							Recovery received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63, based on 28 reviews. Allmusic's David Jeffries praised Eminem's performance as potent and energetic, and said that the album "may be flawed ... but he hasn't sounded this unfiltered and proud since The Marshall Mathers LP". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph commended him for addressing more mature, introspective subject matter and successfully "framing his misogyny, homophobia and all-round bigotry with an undeniable sense of empathy and humanity." Jody Rosen, writing in Rolling Stone, called it Eminem's "most casual-sounding album in years" and said that he "sounds content to be rap's wittiest head case."Sam Wolfson of NME called him "self aware, technically advanced, intelligent, able to go at speeds other than full throttle". Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club felt that his lively raps make up for the "endless atonement metaphors" that occasionally weigh down the album. Kitty Empire, writing in The Observer, said that it is "better than average" as a "latterday Eminem album" that shows, "in bursts, Eminem's health is very nearly rude." MSN Music's Robert Christgau said that, although the cleverness "varies" and the themes "rarely" upheld by his "long-recessive sense of play", the album is a comeback "for Eminem, not Slim Shady—and for Marshall at his most martial. His most confessional as well".
						</p>
						<p>
							In a mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times regarded Eminem as "frustratingly limited in his topical range" and called Recovery "the most insular of all his releases". Andy Gill of The Independent commented that "there's nothing here quite as witty or engaging as" on his previous work. Pitchfork Media's Jayson Greene perceived a lack of lyrical depth and wrote "for the first time in his career, he actually sounds clumsy". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot said that it lacks hooks and fun: "The subversive humor is long gone, and his cultural references ... remain dated". Slant Magazine's M.T. Richards also found Eminem's pop culture references "inane" and called the album's material "unsurprisingly hollow" with punchlines that "rarely resonate".[90] Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss found his rhyme schemes "dazzling" and wordplay "clever", but panned its production as "monochromatic and monotonous". The Guardian's Paul MacInnes said that the music lacks consistency because of a "piecemeal approach to production" and "fashionable soft-rock samples".
						</p>

"We fully expect to be releasing a new Eminem album in 2013. He's been working on it for some time," said Rosenberg. "It's safe to say that it will be post-Memorial Day at some point, but we're not exactly sure when. We've got some dates locked in for him to perform live in Europe in August, so we're trying to see what else lines up." On March 22, 2013 Dr. Dre was interviewed on Big Boy's Neighborhood on Power 106, where he said that he was working with Eminem, and that Eminem was "finishing up his project."[

I DJ for him and I'm not at liberty to speak on much, but you know his caliber and what he does. Clearly going to further territories. I think what you would expect, especially after the last go-round. He was just getting his feet back on Relapse and then Recovery just came with the smash hits and everything and I think now — he's Eminem." Prior to the announcement of the album's name, it was named to multiple "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" lists; including MTV,[14] Complex Magazine where it was listed in sixth position (and later on in second); and XXL, where it was listed in fifth.

							Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision Blizzard, explained to Billboard in August 2013 that he was contacted by Eminem's manager Rosenberg in March to partner Eminem with Call of Duty: Ghosts. In June, Riley and members of his team flew to Detroit to meet Eminem and Rosenberg. The team was showcased a "handful" of songs, while Eminem was shown early concept art and gameplay footage of Ghosts. "Survival" was picked as the best-fitting song, but the final version differed vastly from the earliest version of the track. Over the next couple of months, Eminem turned in five successive versions of the song, each one "bigger and more anthemic sounding than the last." - The final version was turned in only a day before its reveal on August 14.

							In a behind the scenes video for "Berzerk", released in October 2013, Rubin explained that he met Rosenberg a few years back and that they had discussed the possibility of him and Eminem working together. He stated that the idea of "throwback" song to earlier hip hop recordings was an idea conceived later in the creative process of the album. He noted that initial sample the song was built around ended up not being used, and that the final product differs greatly from the original. In an October 2013 interview, DVLP said that the instrumental for "Rap God" had been in the making two years prior to the track's release. While the instrumental had been offered to rappers such as T.I. and Fabolous, the producer didn't feel the record fit their music. He estimated that Shady Records got hold of the instrumental around Fall 2012, and DVLP himself did not hear "Rap God" until Eminem phoned him after its release.
						</p>
						<p>
							The idea of a sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP came about after Eminem recorded a handful of songs in the early stages of the creation of the album that reminded him and his friends, namely Rosenberg, of Eminem's earlier recordings; " The more I listened to it, the more it made sense to call it that," said Eminem. Eminem also wanted to experiment with "retro, vintage" sounds such as beatbreaks and scratches, and he felt that Rubin could help him "take that to another level."

Rexha recorded "The Monster" in November 2012 in Harlem's Stadium Red studio while working on her debut album. The producer of the track, Frequency, auditioned records for Shady Records VP of A&R Riggs Morales, who "freaked out" upon hearing "The Monster", instantly requesting for the verses to be stripped and Pro Tools sessions sent to Eminem. Eminem added his own verses and tweaked the instrumental, while keeping Rexha's backing vocals. while leaving and the song was revealed to be a part of the album with the reveal of the tracklisting. In an October 2013 interview, Rexha claimed that she said "This is an Eminem record, y'all" while standing in the booth after she recorded the chorus, and that she "know[s] when [Eminem] heard it, it spoke to him."

He would later be confirmed as the producer of "Asshole" and two of the deluxe edition bonus tracks. "Asshole" was initially crated during a studio session with Alex and Eminem in Detroit in 2012. Grey was writing songs for her Eminem-executive-produced album Don't Look Down in Detroit, and visited Eminem to exchange song ideas and hooks. She wrote the hook for "Asshole" during the trip, while in her hotel room.

							"Legacy" was written approximately two years ago during a session between singer-songwriter Polina and songwriter David Brook in New York. A few months later, Polina visited Interscope executive Neil Jacobson, who, upon hearing the song, commanded her: "Don't play this for anyone. It's an Eminem record." The following week, Polina and Brook joined Emile in the studio where he produced the song and then sent it to Eminem. Eminem added his own verses to the song, but left Polina's vocals untouched.

							The Marshall Mathers LP 2 has received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 32 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews." This makes the album Eminem's best-rated project on the website since The Eminem Show.
							Paul MacInnes of The Guardian gave the album a perfect five star rating saying, "Eminem has engaged with his age ... decided he doesn't give a fuck and asserted himself again. There is confidence and maturity ... introspection and regret ... balanced with a clear idea of his place in rap's history. His flows are exceptional ... the wordplay is dazzling. The jokes, in places offensive, are relentless ... There is no apology ... no concession; just a virtuoso application of talent." Jim Farber of the New York Daily News stated, "the album offers a resounding return to the gory comedy and free embrace psychosis that first made Em the anti hero of our age. It's his funniest album in years, as well as his fastest, verbally.[81] Jon Dolan of the Rolling Stone said, "Nostalgia is everywhere. [..] He's playing his best character, the demon spawn of Trailer Hell, America, hitting middle age with his middle finger up his nose while he cleans off the Kool-Aid his kids spilled on the couch". Christopher Weingarten of Spin said, "if rapping were purely an athletic competition, Eminem would be Michael Phelps and Lou Retton combined: pure ability and flexibility, like a bullet with only white-hot hate in his wake". He would go on to add that "we get rhymes ... more rhymes than some rappers manage in a whole career".[85] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times stated, "Eminem sounds more alive - angrier yet fully present - than he has in years ... Eminem burns with purpose on "MMLP2". And if you don't like what he (still) has to say, there's a chance he doesn't either".
						</p>
						<p>
							Edna Gundersen of USA Today said, Eminem "recaptures the original releases wild, clever, emotional brilliance in a flurry of caustic, brazenly honest, rapid-fire rhymes and aggressive beats". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave the album a positive review saying, "If anything, the sequel is more intense than the original, as the Detroit rapper explodes like an M-80 ... many memorable ones to be heard here, as Eminem doubles down on his manic flow, bursting with analogies, jokes, illusions, and ingenious wordplay with dizzying speed and skill".[89] The Washington Post gave the album a positive review saying, "It's satisfying on every level - as a story, as poetry, as a performance ... One thing is immediately clear though: Eminem is the only rapper to survive a guest appearance from the cutthroat Kendrick Lamar. And really, what more do you need to know?"[90] Dan Rys of XXL gave the album a rating of XL saying, "the thing that carries Em through is the diversity of his flows, and his ability to rap over anything ... you're getting one with more perspective, a version which has seen 13 more years and has a different outlook on some of the same topics that he first visited in 2000".[91] Darryl Sterdan of the Toronto Sun gave the album a perfect four star rating saying, "...one of his most enjoyable albums in years ... hilariously shocking and wicked, skewering everyone in his path (including himself)." and "It's the Eminem you know and love (and love to hate)."[92] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club gave the album a B rating, saying "...after years of stagnancy and tedious anger, he shows real growth on The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem has always rapped with forceful determination out of compulsive drives to prove himself to doubters, cut down his enemies, and retain his commercial foothold. For the first time in far too long, he sounds like he's rapping because he enjoys it, too."[80] Jon Carmanica of The New York Times gave the album a positive review saying, "His lyrics are best viewed under a microscope ... to see how he gets from one rhyme to the next in unexpected ways ... he'll dominate almost any sound ... but he still has some old habits, still heavy-handed with homophobic slurs ... Eminem is still rapping from deep inside his cave, as if he's had no new experiences to draw from."[93] David Jeffries of AllMusic spoke of the album saying, it is a "vicious, infectious, hilarious triumph ... a super villain so familiar with hate and depression, he's powered by all shades of anger ... most of the best moments on MMLP2 are just as angry and just as irresponsible ... Eminem at his very best." Luke Fox of Exclaim! gave the album an eight out ten rating praising the albums "astounding wordplay and creative beat choices".
						</p>
						<p>
							In a mixed review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune gave the album two out of four stars saying, "it reaffirms his prodigious agility with rhymes ... Eminem still crunches together syllables, silliness and storytelling flights of ridiculousness with acrobatic skill" and "The sense that we've all been here before, twice, is exacerbated by tired samples and interpolations. [..] Eminem tries to cover up his retreat by doing cartwheels and back-flips with his rhymes".[96] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media gave the album a mixed review saying, "Eminem is a titan with wordplay, but MMLP2 once again finds him at a loss for how to apply his talents." Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C+ criticizing Eminem's use of slurs on the album, saying "Eminem wouldn't be Eminem ... if he didn't allot some of his whizbang homophobic slurs and misogynistic fantasies ... rightly considered a rap great for his technical prowess, wicked humor, and tenacity ... which make his flashes of hatred for women and gay men all the more alarming."

						<h1>Accolades</h1>
						<p>
							Closing out the year, The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was named to multiple "Albums of the Year" lists. It was ranked at number 24 on Rolling Stone's list of the 50 best albums of 2013. XXL named it the second best album of the year. They commented saying, "Three years after his widely praised album Recovery, Em tapped into his former self for Marshall Mathers LP 2. Slim Shady, along with the characters and stories from the first installment, are peppered throughout his latest effort. The Rap God also displays his lyrical prowess on songs like “Love Game” with Kendrick Lamar, the tribute to his mother in “Headlights," and the old school rap-rock ode "Berzerk." Em also supplies the world with another Rihanna collaboration that ups the expectations for fans every time their name is paired together. Overall, Eminem proves once again that his second wind is just as good as his glory days." Spin also ranked it at number 28 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013, saying "His eighth solo album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, is an unwieldy beast; an imperfect yet mostly thrilling verbal-gymnastics routine that sticks the landing in the zone of Bad Taste with arms proudly raised." Complex ranked the album number six, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013, praising it as Eminem's best album since The Eminem Show. It was positioned at number 64 on MusicOMH's list of the top 100 of the year. It was also listed at number 48 on the PopMatters list of the best albums of 2013.
